Where basically we created two **entrypoints** that are listening in the port 80 and 443. Also when traefic recieve the request from 443, it will ask to the **resolver** that handle the certificate with [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/es/) and check if the domain has https. Finally if everything goes fine, it will redirect the request to the proper server that is linked to the router(in this case, gunicorn).
